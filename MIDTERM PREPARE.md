#MIDTERM PREPARE

- Be able to answer questions like the ones in Lesson Exercise Week1, Exercises 11 to 17

- Be ready to calculate slope, intercept, SSR, SSE, SST, R^2, error degrees of freedom, model degrees of freedom, F-statistic with a spreadsheet, RMSE. The number of x, y samples could range anywhere between 8 to 20.
- Be able to calculate R^2 and the F-Statistic by hand.
- Be able to build a linear regression model in Python for the least square regression model developed in your spreadsheet.
- Be ready to manually calculate the p-value that appears in the model summary for the X coefficient in your Python model.
- Be able to manually create a model from the model summary that is generated by Python during multiple linear regression. Use only statistically significant coefficients. Interpret the model by describing the significant coefficients.
- Discuss the meaning behind the diagram in figure 6 of lesson week2.
- Answer a short answer question on binning. Explain the benefits of binning and when it might be used.
- Answer a short answer question on dummy variables. Explain their benefits and why they are used.
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of treating outliers.
- Explain the concerns and benefits of imputing. Suggest alternatives for binning and why they might be used.

Logistic regression:

- Know what a sigmoid function is used for and what it looks like. Be able to draw it.
- Be able to manually calculate a confusion matrix.
- Be able to manually calculate and interpret accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
- I may add 2 or 3 topics for logistic regression next week.
